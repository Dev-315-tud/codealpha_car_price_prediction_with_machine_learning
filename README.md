# codealpha_car_price_prediction_with_machine_learning
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. Developed during a one-month internship at CodeAlpha, the model leverages historical car data to understand the relationship between present price and selling price, achieving an accuracy of approximately 80%.
