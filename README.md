# codealpha_car_price_prediction_with_machine_learning
This car price prediction project was developed during my one-month internship at CodeAlpha, focusing on applying machine learning techniques to real-world data. Using linear regression, the goal was to predict the selling price of used cars based on features such as present price, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. The dataset was imported and processed using Pandas, and visualized with Matplotlib to understand the relationship between present price and selling price. These visualizations revealed a strong linear correlation, which guided the model design. The model was built using Scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression and achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%, indicating reliable performance. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. It also helped me understand the importance of feature selection and visualization in improving model accuracy. Overall, this internship project was a valuable step in my journey toward becoming a proficient machine learning developer.
